<h2>ABOUT ME:</h2>

<p>Hey everyone! I am Kashish Seth if you didn't know, and there is so much to know about me. I am just 13 years old, I 
    know!, It's hard being a teenager; sometimes I don't even feel like one! I love to bake, draw, paint, play with my 
    little sister who's only 5 years old and is in Pre-Kindergarten right now with just her first month of being there! 
</p>

<p> Below, you can see some of the cakes I have made so far!</p>
